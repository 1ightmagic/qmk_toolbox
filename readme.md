# QMK Toolbox

This is a collection of useful tools packaged into one app. This is a pretty recent developement, but is looking to replace the QMK Flasher.

Currently it can:

 * Flash .hex files to DFU-compatible bootloaders
 * Listen to HID console messages from QMK boards

## How to download

Currently there is only a Windows version, and you can get [the latest release here](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases).
